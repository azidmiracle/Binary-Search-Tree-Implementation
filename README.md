# Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation

Using the LINKED LIST IMPLEMENTATION:
1.	Display the following menu:

* [1]	Insert node to binary tree
* [2]	Delete node from binary tree
* [3]	Minimum
* [4]	Maximum
* [5]	Successor
* [6]	Predecessor
* [7]	Search
* [8]	Print BST

2.	Start off with an empty tree.
3.	When the user chooses [1], the program prompts the user to enter a value. After searching for its proper position, the node is then inserted into the BST.
4.	When the user chooses [2], the program asks the user what value to delete. The value is deleted if it is found in the BST. An error is shown if no value exists.
5.	Choosing [3] displays the minimum value in the BST.
6.	Choosing [4] displays the maximum.
7.	Choosing [5] would display the successor of a node of which the value has been specified by the user.
8.	Choosing [6] displays the predecessor of the node whose value has been specified by the user.
9.	Choosing [7] searches for the value specified by the user. Display a message if the value is not in the BST.
10.	Choosing [8] prints out the contents of the BST in increasing order.


* IMPORTANT: Create your own linked list. Do not make use of the built in lists and queues in C#.
